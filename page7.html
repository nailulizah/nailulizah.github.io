    <div class="static" style="text-align: justify;">
        static is the default value. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way. A static element is said to be not positioned and an element with its position set to anything else is said to be positioned.
    </div>
    <div class="relative1" style="text-align: justify;">
        relative behaves the same as static unless you add some extra properties.
    </div>
    <div class="relative2" style="text-align: justify;">
        Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
    </div>
    <div class="fixed" style="text-align: justify;">
        Hello! Don't pay attention to me yet.
    </div>
    <div class="relative" style="text-align: justify;">
        This element is relatively-positioned. If this element was position: static; its absolutely-positioned child would escape and would be positioned relative to the document body.
        <div class="absolute" style="text-align: justify;">
            This element is absolutely-positioned. It's positioned relative to its parent.
