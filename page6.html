    <div class="static" style="text-align: justify;">
        static is the default value. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way. A static element is said to be not positioned and an element with its position set to anything else is said to be positioned.
    </div>
    <div class="relative1" style="text-align: justify;">
        relative behaves the same as static unless you add some extra properties.
    </div>
    <div class="relative2" style="text-align: justify;">
        Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
    </div>
